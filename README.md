PORTAL of Pi - RaspberyPi based PORTAL device. Certified UNIX Network Technicians only!

Development and Design Guide
=============================

Guide
=====

This will guide you through configuring an Arch based RaspberryPi installation
which transparently forwards all TCP traffic over the Tor network. There is 
also a Tor SOCKS proxy for explicitly interacting with the Tor network, either
for more security, or to access a Hidden Service.

The configuration of access to the Internet is left as an exercise to the reader.
